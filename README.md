Google Home assistant for music recommendations, built with Go and Redis. Using Google Home and API.ai

In a nutshell this service consists of the following

* a very light Go web API (https://github.com/jesseward/songexplorer) 
* An agent created at api.ai
* All api.ai intents, with the exception of the 'help' intent  are answered by the songdiscover webhook (this Go app).
* A self hosted Go app. Its sole purpose is to massage communication between api.api and the last.fm API. Calls that result in a redis miss, pass through to the last.fm API.

# Example Google Home invocations
